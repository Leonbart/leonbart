## Projects
These are the projects I've been working on lately:

### Flight Deck
Flight Deck is an app where aircraft pilots can keep a record of their flights information, which is a requirement to get certifications and licenses.
While mainly targeted to pilots, the application allows to login with three different profiles: pilot, intructor, and company.
Each of these profiles has specific functionalities and statistics based on the app usage.
Instructors can approve the pilots training flights.
Companies can search for pilots filtering them by various topics. And then communicate with them through the app's chat in order to schedule and interview.

### Pok√©mon
With this App you will be able to display all Pok√©mons and their stats.
You can also search them, filter and order them by some characteristic, and even create new ones.
Pok√©mon is an electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in February 1996 as Pok√©mon Green and Pok√©mon Red. The franchise later became wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The series, originally produced for the company's Game Boy line of handheld consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of Pok√©mon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon became one of the most successful video game franchises in the world.

### Rick & Morty
With this App you will be able to display the info about all your favorite characters of Rick and Morty.
Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite number of realities, often travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying saucer.
